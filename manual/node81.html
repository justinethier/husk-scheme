This procedure returns a specifier for the environment that
results by starting with an empty environment and then
importing each list , considered as an import set, into it.
(See section 5.6 for a description of import sets.) The
bindings of the environment represented by the specifier
are immutable, as is the environment itself.

If version is equal to 5, corresponding to R5RS,
scheme-report-environment returns a specifier for an environment
that contains only the bindings defined in the
R5RS library. Implementations must support this value of
version.
  <div class="p"> </div>
  <br />
Implementations may also support other values of version,
in which case they return a specifier for an environment
containing bindings corresponding to the specified version
of the report. If version is neither 5 nor another value
supported by the implementation, an error is signaled.
  <div class="p"> </div>
  <br />
The effect of defining or assigning (through the use of eval)
an identifier bound in a scheme-report-environment (for
example car) is unspecified. Thus both the environment
and the bindings it contains may be immutable.

If version is equal to 5, corresponding to R5RS, the

keywords defined in the R5RS library. Implementations
must support this value of version.

Implementations may also support other values of version,
in which case they return a specifier for an environment
containing appropriate bindings corresponding to the speci
fied version of the report. If version is neither 5 nor another
value supported by the implementation, an error is
signaled.

This procedure returns a specifier for a mutable environment
that contains an implementation-defined set of bindings,
typically a superset of those exported by (scheme
base). The intent is that this procedure will return the
environment in which the implementation would evaluate
expressions entered by the user into a REPL.

If expr-or-def is an expression, it is evaluated in the speci-
fied environment and its values are returned. If it is a defi-
nition, the specified identifier(s) are defined in the specified
environment, provided the environment is not immutable.
