<p>
Mathematically, numbers are arranged into a tower of subtypes
in which each level is a subset of the level above it:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>number</li>
    <li>complex number</li>
    <li>real number</li>
    <li>rational number</li>
    <li>integer</li>
</ul>

<p>
For example, 3 is an integer. Therefore 3 is also a rational,
a real, and a complex number. The same is true of the
Scheme numbers that model 3. For Scheme numbers, these
types are defined by the predicates number?, complex?,
the same integer.
</p>
<p>
Scheme's numerical operations treat numbers as abstract
data, as independent of their representation as possible.
Although Husk may use multiple
internal representations of numbers, this ought not to be
apparent to a casual programmer writing simple programs.
