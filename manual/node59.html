<P>
A library definition takes the following form:
</p>
<P>
<div class="code-block">
(define-library {library-name}
  {library declaration} ...)
</div>
</p>
<P>
{library name} is a list whose members are identifiers and exact non-negative integers.  It is used to
identify the library uniquely when importing from other programs or
libraries.
Libraries whose first identifier is <code>scheme</code> are reserved for use by this
report and future versions of this report.
Libraries whose first identifier is <code>srfi</code> are reserved for libraries
implementing Scheme Requests for Implementation.
It is inadvisable, but not an error, for identifiers in library names to
contain any of the characters <code>| <code>&#92;</code> ? * &lt; " : &gt; + [ ] /</code>
or control characters after escapes are expanded.
</P>
<P>
A library declaration is any of:
</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><code>(export {export spec} ...)</code>
</LI>
<LI><code>(import {import set} ...) </code>
</LI>
<LI><code>(begin {command or definition} ...)</code>
</LI>
<LI><code>(include {filename1} {filename2} ...)</code>
</LI>
<!-- JAE TODO: not supported at this time
<LI><code>(include-library-declarations {filename1}
{filename2} ...)</code>
</LI>
<LI><code>(cond-expand {ce-clause1} {ce-clause2} ...)</code>
</LI>
-->
</UL>
</p>
<P>
An <code>export</code> declaration specifies a list of identifiers which
can be made visible to other libraries or programs.
An export spec takes one of the following forms:
</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><code>{identifier}</code>
</LI>
<LI><code>(rename {identifier1} {identifier2})</code>
</LI>
</UL>
</p>
<P>
In an export spec, an identifier names a single
binding defined within or imported into the library, where the
external name for the export is the same as the name of the binding
within the library. A <code>rename</code> spec exports the binding 
defined within or imported into the library and named by
{identifier1} in each ({identifier1} {identifier2} pairing, using 
{identifier2} as the external name.
</P>
<P>
An <code>import</code> declaration provides a way to import the identifiers
exported by another library.  It has the same syntax and semantics as
an import declaration used in a program or at the REPL (see section&nbsp;<A HREF="node51.html#import">5.2</A>).
</P>
<P>
The <code>begin</code> and <code>include</code> declarations are
used to specify the body of
the library.  They have the same syntax and semantics as the corresponding
expression types.
This form of <code>begin</code> is analogous to, but not the same as, the
two types of <code>begin</code> defined in section&nbsp;<A HREF="node38.html#sequencing">4.2.3</A>.
</P>
<!-- JAE TODO: not supported at this time
<P>
The <code>include-library-declarations</code> declaration is similar to
<code>include</code> except that the contents of the file are spliced directly into the
current library definition.  This can be used, for example, to share the
same <code>export</code> declaration among multiple libraries as a simple
form of library interface.
</P>
<P>
The <code>cond-expand</code> declaration has the same syntax and semantics as
the <code>cond-expand</code> expression type, except that it expands to
spliced-in library declarations rather than expressions enclosed in <code>begin</code>.
</P>
-->
<P>
When a library is loaded, its expressions are executed
in textual order.
If a library's definitions are referenced in the expanded form of a
program or library body, then that library must be loaded before the
expanded program or library body is evaluated. This rule applies
transitively.  If a library is imported by more than one program or
library, it may possibly be loaded additional times.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, during the expansion of a library <code>(foo)</code>, if any syntax
keywords imported from another library <code>(bar)</code> are needed to expand
the library, then the library <code>(bar)</code> must be expanded and its syntax
definitions evaluated before the expansion of <code>(foo)</code>.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the number of times that a library is loaded, each
program or library that imports bindings from a library must do so from a
single loading of that library, regardless of the number of import
declarations in which it appears.
That is, <code>(import (only (foo) a))</code> followed by <code>(import (only (foo) b))</code>
has the same effect as <code>(import (only (foo) a b))</code>.
