An identifier can name either a type of syntax or
a location where a value can be stored.  An identifier that names a type
of syntax is called a <EM>syntactic keyword</EM>
and is said to be <EM>bound</EM> to a transformer for that syntax.  An identifier that names a
location is called a <EM>variable</EM> and is said to be
<EM>bound</EM> to that location.  The set of all visible
bindings in effect at some point in a program is
known as the <EM>environment</EM> in effect at that point.  The value
stored in the location to which a variable is bound is called the
variable's value.  By abuse of terminology, the variable is sometimes
said to name the value or to be bound to the value.  This is not quite
accurate, but confusion rarely results from this practice.
</p>
<P>
Certain expression types are used to create new kinds of syntax
and to bind syntactic keywords to those new syntaxes, while other
expression types create new locations and bind variables to those
locations.  These expression types are called <EM>binding constructs</EM>.
Those that bind syntactic keywords are listed in section&nbsp;<A HREF="node45.html#macrosection">4.3</A>.
The most fundamental of the variable binding constructs is the
<code>lambda</code> expression, because all other variable binding constructs
can be explained in terms of <code>lambda</code> expressions.  The other
variable binding constructs are <code>let</code>, <code>let*</code>, <code>letrec</code>,
<code>letrec*</code>, <code>let-values</code>, <code>let*-values</code>,
and <code>do</code> expressions (see sections&nbsp;<A HREF="node31.html#lambda">4.1.4</A>, <A HREF="node37.html#letrec">4.2.2</A>, and
<A HREF="node39.html#do">4.2.4</A>).
</p>
<P>
Scheme is a language with
block structure.  To each place where an identifier is bound in a program
there corresponds a <EM>region</EM> of the program text within which
the binding is visible.  The region is determined by the particular
binding construct that establishes the binding; if the binding is
established by a <code>lambda</code> expression, for example, then its region
is the entire <code>lambda</code> expression.  Every mention of an identifier
refers to the binding of the identifier that established the
innermost of the regions containing the use.  If there is no binding of
the identifier whose region contains the use, then the use refers to the
binding for the variable in the global environment, if any
(chapters&nbsp;<A HREF="node26.html#expressionchapter">4</A> and <A HREF="node62.html#initialenv">6</A>); if there is no
binding for the identifier,
it is said to be <EM>unbound</EM>.
