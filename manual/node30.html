A procedure call is written by enclosing in parentheses an
expression for the procedure to be called followed by expressions for the arguments to be
passed to it.  The operator and operand expressions are evaluated (in an
unspecified order) and the resulting procedure is passed the resulting
arguments.

(+ 3 4)             ==&gt; 7

  <p>
The procedures in this document are available as the values of variables exported by the
standard libraries.  For example, the addition and multiplication
procedures in the above examples are the values of the variables <code>+</code>
and <code>*</code> in the base library.  New procedures are created by evaluating <code>lambda</code> expressions
(see section&nbsp;<A HREF="node31.html#lambda">4.1.4</A>).
</p>
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
<p>
Procedure calls can return any number of values (see <code>values</code> in
section&nbsp;<A HREF="node79.html#proceduresection">6.10</A>).
Most of the procedures defined in this report return one
value or, for procedures such as <code>apply</code>, pass on the values returned
by a call to one of their arguments.
Exceptions are noted in the individual descriptions.
</p>
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
<P>
<EM>Note:</EM> In contrast to other dialects of Lisp, the order of
evaluation is unspecified, and the operator expression and the operand
expressions are always evaluated with the same evaluation rules.
</p>
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
</p>
<p>
<EM>Note:</EM> Although the order of evaluation is otherwise unspecified, the effect of
any concurrent evaluation of the operator and operand expressions is
constrained to be consistent with some sequential order of evaluation.
The order of evaluation may be chosen differently for each procedure call.
  <div class="p"><!----></div>
<EM>Note:</EM> In many dialects of Lisp, the empty list, <code>()</code>, is a legitimate expression evaluating to itself.  In Scheme, it is an error.
