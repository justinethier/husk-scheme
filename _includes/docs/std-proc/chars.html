procedure:  (char? obj) 
Returns #t if obj is a character, otherwise returns #f.

procedure:  (char=? char1 char2) 
procedure:  (char<? char1 char2) 
procedure:  (char>? char1 char2) 
procedure:  (char<=? char1 char2) 
procedure:  (char>=? char1 char2) 
These procedures impose a total ordering on the set of characters. It is guaranteed that under this ordering:

The upper case characters are in order. For example, (char<? #\A #\B) returns #t.
The lower case characters are in order. For example, (char<? #\a #\b) returns #t.
The digits are in order. For example, (char<? #\0 #\9) returns #t.
Either all the digits precede all the upper case letters, or vice versa.
Either all the digits precede all the lower case letters, or vice versa.
Some implementations may generalize these procedures to take more than two arguments, as with the corresponding numerical predicates.

library procedure:  (char-ci=? char1 char2) 
library procedure:  (char-ci<? char1 char2) 
library procedure:  (char-ci>? char1 char2) 
library procedure:  (char-ci<=? char1 char2) 
library procedure:  (char-ci>=? char1 char2) 
These procedures are similar to char=? et cetera, but they treat upper case and lower case letters as the same. For example, (char-ci=? #\A #\a) returns #t. Some implementations may generalize these procedures to take more than two arguments, as with the corresponding numerical predicates.

library procedure:  (char-alphabetic? char) 
library procedure:  (char-numeric? char) 
library procedure:  (char-whitespace? char) 
library procedure:  (char-upper-case? letter) 
library procedure:  (char-lower-case? letter) 
These procedures return #t if their arguments are alphabetic, numeric, whitespace, upper case, or lower case characters, respectively, otherwise they return #f. The following remarks, which are specific to the ASCII character set, are intended only as a guide: The alphabetic characters are the 52 upper and lower case letters. The numeric characters are the ten decimal digits. The whitespace characters are space, tab, line feed, form feed, and carriage return.

procedure:  (char->integer char) 
procedure:  (integer->char n) 
Given a character, char->integer returns an exact integer representation of the character. Given an exact integer that is the image of a character under char->integer, integer->char returns that character. These procedures implement order-preserving isomorphisms between the set of characters under the char<=? ordering and some subset of the integers under the <= ordering. That is, if


(char<=? a b) ===> #t  and  (<= x y) ===> #t

and x and y are in the domain of integer->char, then


(<= (char->integer a)
    (char->integer b))                 ===>  #t
    
    (char<=? (integer->char x)
             (integer->char y))             ===>  #t
             
             library procedure:  (char-upcase char) 
             library procedure:  (char-downcase char) 
             These procedures return a character char2 such that (char-ci=? char char2). In addition, if char is alphabetic, then the result of char-upcase is upper case and the result of char-downcase is lower case.
