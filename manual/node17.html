<P>
<EM>Whitespace</EM> characters include the space, tab, and newline characters.
(Implementations may provide additional whitespace characters such
as page break.)  Whitespace is used for improved readability and
as necessary to separate tokens from each other, a token being an
indivisible lexical unit such as an identifier or number, but is
otherwise insignificant.  Whitespace can occur between any two tokens,
but not within a token.  Whitespace occurring inside a string
or inside a symbol delimited by vertical lines
is significant.
</p>
<P>
The lexical syntax includes several comment forms.  
Comments are treated exactly like whitespace.
</p>
<P>
A semicolon (<code>;</code>) indicates the start of a line comment.
The comment continues to the
end of the line on which the semicolon appears.  
</p>
<P>
<P>
Block comments are indicated with properly nested <code>#|</code> and <code>|#</code> pairs.
