<P>
This section gives an overview of Scheme's semantics.  A
detailed informal semantics is the subject of
chapters&nbsp;<A HREF="node20.html#basicchapter">3</A> through&nbsp;<A HREF="node62.html#builtinchapter">6</A>. 
<P>
Scheme is a statically scoped programming
language.  Each use of a variable is associated with a lexically
apparent binding of that variable.
</P>
<P>
Scheme is a dynamically typed language.  Types
are associated with values (also called objects) rather than
with variables.  
Statically typed languages, by contrast, associate types with
variables and expressions as well as with values.
<P>
All objects created in the course of a Scheme computation, including
procedures and continuations, have unlimited extent.
No Scheme object is ever destroyed.  The reason that
implementations of Scheme do not (usually!) run out of storage is that
they are permitted to reclaim the storage occupied by an object if
they can prove that the object cannot possibly matter to any future
computation.  
<P>
Implementations of Scheme are required to be properly tail-recursive.
This allows the execution of an iterative computation in constant space,
even if the iterative computation is described by a syntactically
recursive procedure.  Thus with a properly tail-recursive implementation,
iteration can be expressed using the ordinary procedure-call
mechanics, so that special iteration constructs are useful only as
syntactic sugar.  See section&nbsp;<A HREF="node25.html#proper_tail_recursion">3.5</A>.
<P>
Scheme procedures are objects in their own right.  Procedures can be
created dynamically, stored in data structures, returned as results of
procedures, and so on.  
</P>
<P>
One distinguishing feature of Scheme is that continuations, which
in most other languages only operate behind the scenes, also have
``first-class'' status.  Continuations are useful for implementing a
wide variety of advanced control constructs, including non-local exits,
backtracking, and coroutines.  See section&nbsp;<A HREF="node79.html#continuations">6.10</A>.
</P>
<P>
Arguments to Scheme procedures are always passed by value, which
means that the actual argument expressions are evaluated before the
procedure gains control, regardless of whether the procedure needs the
result of the evaluation.  
</P>
<P>
Scheme's model of arithmetic is designed to remain as independent as
possible of the particular ways in which numbers are represented within a
computer. In Scheme, every integer is a rational number, every rational is a
real, and every real is a complex number.  Thus the distinction between integer
and real arithmetic, so important to many programming languages, does not
appear in Scheme.  In its place is a distinction between exact arithmetic,
which corresponds to the mathematical ideal, and inexact arithmetic on
approximations.  Exact arithmetic is not limited to integers.
