<P>
Husk provides an interactive session called a
<EM>REPL</EM> (Read-Eval-Print Loop), where import declarations,
expressions and definitions can be
entered and evaluated one at a time.  For convenience and ease of use,
the global Scheme environment in a REPL
must not be empty, but must start out with at least the bindings provided by the
base library.  This library includes the core syntax of Scheme
and generally useful procedures that manipulate data.  For example, the
variable <code>abs</code> is bound to a
procedure of one argument that computes the absolute value of a
number, and the variable <code>+</code> is bound to a procedure that computes
sums.  The full list of <code>(scheme base)</code> bindings can be found in
Appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="node97.html#stdlibraries">A</A>.

<!--
<P>
Implementations may provide an initial REPL environment 
which behaves as if all possible variables are bound to locations, most of
which contain unspecified values.  Top level REPL definitions in
such an implementation are truly equivalent to assignments,
unless the identifier is defined as a syntax keyword.
</P>-->
<P>
An implementation may provide a mode of operation in which the REPL
reads its input from a file.  Such a file is not, in general, the same
as a program, because it can contain import declarations in places other than
the beginning.
</P>
<P>
The Husk REPL can be started by running the <code>huski</code> program.
