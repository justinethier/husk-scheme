<p>
A number can be written in binary, octal, decimal, or hexadecimal
by the use of a radix prefix. The radix prefixes
are #b (binary), #o (octal), #d (decimal), and #x (hexadecimal).
With no radix prefix, a number is assumed to be
expressed in decimal.
</p>
<!--
<p>
A numerical constant can be specified to be either exact or
inexact by a prefix. The prefixes are #e for exact, and #i
for inexact. An exactness prefix can appear before or after
any radix prefix that is used. If the written representation
of a number has no exactness prefix, the constant is inexact
if it contains a decimal point or an exponent. Otherwise,
it is exact.
</p>
<p>
In systems with inexact numbers of varying precisions it
can be useful to specify the precision of a constant. For
this purpose, implementations may accept numerical constants
written with an exponent marker that indicates the
desired precision of the inexact representation. If so, the
letter s, f, d, or l, meaning short, single, double, or long
precision, respectively, can be used in place of e. The default
precision has at least as much precision as double,
but implementations may allow this default to be set by
the user.

The numbers positive infinity, negative infinity, and NaN
are written +inf.0, -inf.0 and +nan.0 respectively. NaN
may also be written -nan.0. The use of signs in the written
representation does not necessarily re
ect the underlying
sign of the NaN value, if any. Implementations are not required
to support these numbers, but if they do, they must
do so in general conformance with IEEE 754. However, implementations

<p>
There are two notations provided for non-real complex
numbers: the rectangular notation a+bi, where a is the
real part and b is the imaginary part; and the polar no-
tation r@ where r is the magnitude and is the phase
(angle) in radians. These are related by the equation
a + bi = r cos + (r sin i. All of a, b, r , and are real
numbers.

<p>
Complex numbers may be specified using the syntax a+bi, where
a is the real part and b is the imaginary part.
